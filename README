FAQ

Q: How do I build the portal?
A: First create a vertical frame 4 by 5 from cheese. Then right click to activate it witk Sonic Screwdriver.

Q: How do I build a tent? It says "Couldnt build a tent." What should I do?
A: Well placing a tent is a bit tricky. First you have to make sure you have a flat area 8 by 8 block. Above these platform there have to be at least 4 block of free space (air). Then dig a hole in the middle of this platform and fill it with tent block. This flat platform will be repalced with tent floor.

Q: When I step into portal, I get message about entering the Nehter or the screen freezes with message "Saving Chunks". What should I do?
A: Currently there is some problems with traveling through portal. It seems that The Moon isn't currently compatible with other mods. I personally used clean MC and it worked just fine. Along with TMI. Also make sure you have correct version of ShockAhPI.

Q: How do I get Space Ship?
A: You have to build Builder Bot, fuel him and provide him building materials.

Q: How do I use SpaceShip?
A: First you have to power the Rocket Core. Use button, lever, resstone torch, pressure plate... When Core is powered right-click on it.
