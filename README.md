The Moon - 1.20.2
=================
This code mod is a modern recreation of a Minecraft mod for beta 1.7.3 that 
aimed to add the moon as a playable dimension to the game.

# NOTICE:
This mod is still in very early development and many things won't work properly
(or at all).

Building from source:
---------------------

Open the project in IntelliJ, open the terminal and run `./gradlew build`
